R markdown files and links presenting short tutorials to perform GEA studies and genomic offset analysis from empirical genotype and environmental data.

* LEA 3 Tutorial 

* RDA Tutorial 
  - R code to identify loci under selection using multiple RDA axes (RDAdapt) can be found here: https://github.com/Capblancq/RDA-genome-scan
  - A tutorial on how using RDA to identify loci under selection using each RDA axis independently can be found here: https://popgen.nescent.org/2018-03-27_RDA_GEA.html
  - A tutorial on how using RDA for various landscape genomics applications, including estimating genomic offset, can be found here: https://github.com/Capblancq/RDA-landscape-genomics 

* Gradient Forest (GF) Tutorial runs GF on the same data set as in the LEA 3 tutorial.

* fitzpatrickGDM_GF Tutorial contains an exhaustive set of R functions to run GF and GDM analysis.

* R Tutorial on how to download and manipulate environmental data 



* Tutorial BAYPASS
