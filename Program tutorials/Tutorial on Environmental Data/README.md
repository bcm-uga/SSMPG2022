# Environmental data for landscape genomics studies

This repository provides codes and explanations on how to use environmental data in the field of landscape genomics.

It covers these topics:

* Get a background map and project it
* Get occurrence data and species range
* Download environmental data
* Extract environmental data from occurrences
* Crop layers for EU exten
* Visualise environmental data and explore ecological gradients
* Sampling locations, data extraction and visualisation
* Principal component analysis of environmental data at the sampling locations
* Correlation plot of environmental data at the sampling locations
* Pearson correlation matrix of environmental data at the sampling locations
* Retain uncorrelated variables based on Pearson"s coef < 0.75 and make a PCA

# Support

Send an email to benjamin.dauphin@wsl.ch with a reproducible example if a problem occurs when running the scripts.

# Roadmap

Future work will focus on developing codes and tools to assemble comprehensive environmental datasets at all levels of the biosphere.
