Simulated data -- Thibaut Capblancq

In woolly marmots, three quantitative traits are particularily involved in local adaptation - wool length, wool color and production of lanolin (wool wax). Each one of these traits is coded by a relatively small number of genes and the precise environmental variables driving selection are still unknown but should be among the 10 following variables: 

- BWS: Bad Weather all Summer
- SCW: Super Cold Summer
- WR: Whiteness of the Rocks
- GG: Greenness of the Grass
- LSS: Lots of Snow during Summer 
- PE: Presence of Eagles
- SCW: Super Cold Winter
- DR: Density of Rocks
- TSP: Tons of Skiing Potential
- NTS: Number of Tourists in Summer

Ten individuals were sampled at 61 source localities. 

The fitness of a population at a particular geographic location is defined as the probability of survival of organisms in the current (and future) habitat. 

The genotypes.lfmm data file contains 300  individual samples genotyped at 2333 diploid loci. The format is an n x L matrix, with n = 300 and L = 2333, with individual samples in rows and genetic loci in columns. No missing data.

The metadata.csv file contains meta data for the 300 individuals

"id": individual ids

"pop": population label. Each population contains 10 individuals.

The 10 environmental varibles measure are:
