Simulated data -- Thibaut Capblancq

Ten individuals were sampled at 61 source localities. In woolly marmots, three quantitative trait are particularily involve in local adaptaiton and each of them is coded by a relatively small number of genes.

The precise environmental variables driving local adaptation in woolly marmots are unknown but should be among the 10 measured variables that follow: 
- envir1: SCW: super cold summer
- envir2: LOS: Lots of snow
- envir3:
- envir4:
- envir5:
- envir6:
- envir7:
- envir8:
- envir9:
- envir10:

The fitness of a population at a particular geographic location is defined as the probability of survival of organisms in the current (and future) habitat. 

The genotypes.lfmm data file contains 300  individual samples genotyped at 2333 diploid loci. The format is an n x L matrix, with n = 300 and L = 2333, with individual samples in rows and genetic loci in columns. No missing data.

The metadata.csv file contains meta data for the 300 individuals

"id": individual ids

"pop": population label. Each population contains 10 individuals.

The 10 environmental varibles measure are:
