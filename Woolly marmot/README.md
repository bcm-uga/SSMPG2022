Simulated data -- Thibaut Capblancq

In woolly marmots, three quantitative traits are particularily involved in local adaptation - wool length, wool color and production of lanolin (wool wax). Each one of these traits is coded by a relatively small number of genes and the precise environmental variables driving selection are still unknown but should be among the 10 following variables: 

- BWS: Bad Weather all Summer
- SCW: Super Cold Summer
- WR: Whiteness of the Rocks
- GG: Greenness of the Grass
- LSS: Lots of Snow during Summer 
- PE: Presence of Eagles
- SCW: Super Cold Winter
- DR: Density of Rocks
- TSP: Tons of Skiing Potential
- NTS: Number of Tourists in Summer

Ten individuals were sampled at 61 source localities. The woolly_marmot.pcadapt data file contains 610 individual samples genotyped at 1000 diploid loci. The format is an n x L matrix, with n = 610 and L = 1000, with individual samples in rows and genetic loci in columns. No missing data.

The metadata.txt file contains the following meta data for the 610 individuals

- "pop": population label. Each population contains 10 individuals.
- The 10 environmental varibles measure are:
